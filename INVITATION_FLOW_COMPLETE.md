# Complete User Invitation Flow - Implementation

## Problem Solved
The invitation email link was resulting in a 404 error because the required authentication pages didn't exist.

## Complete Flow Implemented

### 1. **Invitation Process**
1. Firm admin goes to `/firms/[firm-name]/admin`
2. Clicks "Invite User" and enters email
3. System validates email domain matches firm
4. Creates record in `user_invitations` table
5. Sends invitation email via Supabase Auth with SMTP

### 2. **Email Link Flow**
When user clicks the email link:
```
Email Link → Supabase Auth Verification → /auth/complete-profile
```

### 3. **User Journey**
1. **Receives Email**: Professional invitation email with firm branding
2. **Clicks Link**: Supabase verifies the invitation token
3. **Lands on Complete Profile**: `/auth/complete-profile`
4. **Fills Details**: First name, last name, optional password
5. **Account Created**: User profile created and linked to firm
6. **Redirected**: To `/forms` page to start using the system

## Pages Created

### `/auth/complete-profile`
- **Purpose**: Final step for invited users
- **Features**: 
  - Pre-populated with invitation data
  - Collects first/last name
  - Optional password setting
  - Updates user profile and metadata
  - Marks invitation as accepted

### `/auth/signup` 
- **Purpose**: General signup page (with Suspense handling)
- **Features**:
  - Handles both invited and general users
  - Form validation
  - Domain verification for invites
  - Creates user profiles

### `/auth/reset-password`
- **Purpose**: Password reset functionality
- **Features**:
  - Handles password updates
  - Includes invitation detection
  - Redirects invites appropriately

## Technical Implementation

### URL Structure
- **Invitation Email**: Contains Supabase verification URL
- **Redirect Target**: `https://your-domain.com/auth/complete-profile`
- **Success Redirect**: `/forms` for regular users

### Database Updates
- Creates/updates `user_profiles` record
- Links user to firm via `firm_id`
- Marks invitation as accepted in `user_invitations`
- Sets user role as 'user'

### Authentication Flow
1. **Token Verification**: Supabase handles invitation token validation
2. **Session Creation**: User automatically logged in after verification
3. **Profile Completion**: User provides required details
4. **Firm Association**: User linked to inviting firm

## Testing the Flow

### Test a New Invitation:
1. Go to firm admin dashboard
2. Invite a new user with a valid email
3. Check email for invitation
4. Click the link in the email
5. Should land on `/auth/complete-profile`
6. Fill out the form
7. Should redirect to `/forms`

### What Was Fixed:
- ✅ **404 Error**: All required auth pages now exist
- ✅ **User Creation**: Complete signup process
- ✅ **Firm Association**: Users properly linked to firms
- ✅ **Profile Data**: First/last names collected
- ✅ **Invitation Tracking**: Proper acceptance logging
- ✅ **Redirect Flow**: Smooth user experience
