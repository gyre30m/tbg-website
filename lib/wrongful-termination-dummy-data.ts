  // Other Information
  additionalInfo: "David's termination occurred during a company restructuring that he believes was discriminatory. He had received excellent performance reviews and was actively working on a major cost-saving initiative that would have saved the company $2M annually. The termination has caused significant financial strain, as his spouse had to increase her work hours, affecting their children's care arrangements. David has been actively job searching for 8 months but faces age discrimination in his field. The family has had to dip into retirement savings and college funds for their children to maintain their standard of living.",
