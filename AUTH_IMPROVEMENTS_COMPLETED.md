# Auth Improvements Completed

## ✅ Improvements Implemented

### 1. Fixed Auth Context Timing Issues
**File:** `lib/auth-context.tsx`

- Added `useMemo` to calculate `isSiteAdmin` and `isFirmAdmin` values reactively
- This ensures these values update immediately when `userProfile` changes
- Also memoized the entire context value to prevent unnecessary re-renders

```typescript
const isSiteAdmin = useMemo(() => authState.profile?.role === 'site_admin', [authState.profile])
const isFirmAdmin = useMemo(() => authState.profile?.role === 'firm_admin', [authState.profile])
```

### 2. Created RLS UPDATE Policies
**File:** `add-firm-update-policies.sql`

Added UPDATE policies for firm members to edit forms in their firm:
- Personal Injury Forms
- Wrongful Death Forms  
- Wrongful Termination Forms

Also added DELETE policies for firm admins to manage forms in their firm.

**Run this SQL in Supabase:**
```bash
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f add-firm-update-policies.sql
```

### 3. Consolidated Auth State Management
**File:** `lib/auth-context.tsx`

Refactored from multiple state variables to a single `authState` object:
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null
  session: Session | null
  profile: UserProfile | null
  firm: Firm | null
  isLoading: boolean
}
```

Benefits:
- Atomic state updates
- Easier to manage related state
- Backward compatibility maintained with aliases

### 4. Session Refresh Middleware Already Exists ✅
**File:** `middleware.ts`

The middleware was already properly implemented with:
- Automatic session refresh on each request
- Protected route handling
- Proper cookie management

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Auth Context Updates:**
   - Sign in as different user types
   - Verify `isSiteAdmin` and `isFirmAdmin` update immediately
   - Check that Edit Form button appears correctly

2. **Test RLS Policies:**
   - After running the SQL script
   - Verify firm users can edit forms from their firm
   - Verify firm admins can delete forms from their firm

3. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Check for any unnecessary re-renders
   - Verify auth state updates are efficient

## Next Steps

1. Run the RLS policy SQL script in your Supabase dashboard
2. Test the improvements with different user roles
3. Monitor for any edge cases or timing issues
